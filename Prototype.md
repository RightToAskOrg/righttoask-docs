## The RightToAsk Prototype App

**Be aware that this is a prototype for UI testing, not a complete solution.  Many things are not implemented yet, and none of the security or privacy features are present.**

The prototype only runs on Android devices. 
If you'd like to try it out and tell us what you think, start by downloading the Expo app from the [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent).

### Direct download with phone
In your phone's web browser, go to the [righttoask-prototype project](https://expo.io/@vteague/projects/righttoask-prototype) and click on Open Project Using Expo.

### Indirect, with a desktop machine
If accessing the website directly from your phone doesn't work, visit the [righttoask-prototype project](https://expo.io/@vteague/projects/righttoask-prototype) from your desktop machine.  You should see a QR code.

- Open the Expo app on your phone and go to Projects
- Click Scan QR Code

### Trying it out

RightToAsk should now load - you will be prompted to register.

In the main question screen, you can flick downwards to see a list of current questions, which you can upvote or downvote.  You can also ask and tag questions, or sort, search and filter them.
