# Screens and usage 

The Registration screen

:   invites a user to choose a name and (optionally) state their postcode. This also generates a cryptographic key pair.

The Main screen

:   shows the list of current questions and allows search, filter, sort, *etc.* Voters are invited to up-vote or flick past (or possibly explicitly downvote) questions. Voting is immediate, while asking a question requires clicking on a specific icon. It is also possible to report a question as abusive.

    Clicking on the person takes you to their account screen. Clicking on a question takes the user to:

the Question screen

:   which allows for the addition of extra background information, links to Hansard, tag viewing, *etc.* Both questions and background information are character-limited.

The Account settings and verification screen

:   allows an MP to verify a parliamentary email address---the domains of Australian state and federal parliaments are hardcoded. For other organisations, it allows a person to verify that they can access email at a domain that matches the claimed website.

    This screen also allows settings for the externally-visible account screen, including aesthetic settings (photo uploads, colour schemes) and privacy settings (whether the account accepts DMS from nobody, from those they've followed or DM'd, from MPs, or from nobody).

    Some corporate or MP accounts (or possibly even some individual accounts with multiple devices) may register multiple public keys---this means that multiple people may speak for the group.

The Account screen

:   shows the information about the account that that entity (MP,
    citizen, organisation) has chosen to display, along with a list of their questions.
