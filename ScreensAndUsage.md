# Screens and usage {#sec:screensUsage}

The Registration screen

:   invites a user to choose a name and (optionally) state their
    postcode. This also generates a cryptographic key pair.

The Main screen

:   shows the list of current questions and allows search, filter, sort,
    *etc.* Voters are invited to up-vote or flick past (or possibly
    explicitly downvote) questions. Voting is immediate, while asking a
    question requires clicking on a specific icon. It is also possible
    to report a question as abusive.

    Clicking on the person takes you to their account screen. Clicking
    on a question takes the user to:

the Question screen

:   which allows for the addition of extra background information, links
    to Hansard, tag viewing, *etc.* Both questions and background
    information are character-limited.

The Account settings and verification screen

:   allows an MP to verify a parliamentary email address---the domains
    of Australian state and federal parliaments are hardcoded. For other
    organisations, it allows a person to verify that they can access
    email at a domain that matches the claimed website.

    This screen also allows settings for the externally-visible account
    screen, including aesthetic settings (photo uploads, colour schemes)
    and privacy settings (whether the account accepts DMS from nobody,
    from those they've followed or DM'd, from MPs, or from nobody).

    Some corporate or MP accounts (or possibly even some individual
    accounts with multiple devices) may register multiple public
    keys---this means that multiple people may speak for the group.

The Account screen

:   shows the information about the account that that entity (MP,
    citizen, organisation) has chosen to display, along with a list of
    their questions.

*Question: Should clicking on a tag associated with a committee or
inquiry take you to that committee/inquiry homepage? Probably. Perhaps
within the app so you can easily go back.*

Format and function details are described in the spec.
