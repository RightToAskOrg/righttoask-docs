# Possible extra feature: Direct Messages {#sec:DMs}

The system will use its PKI for end-to-end encrypted Direct messages
(DMs).

Default behaviour: an MP can reply (by DM) to any message tagged for
them; a citizen can reply (by DM) to any DM. Of course, these defaults
can be edited to allow more or less receptive DM behaviour.

*Question: Do we have to do anything as complicated as Signal-style
ratcheting, or can we simply use one-pass ECDH?* 

*Question: Maybe MPs should only accept DMs from verified accounts?*

*Question: Perhaps we should just use PGP?*
